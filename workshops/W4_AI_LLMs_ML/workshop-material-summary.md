# AI: LLMs to ML
## Content
Ryan Payton from Microsoft kindly shared his slides about Copilot and LLMs, which are [here](https://github.com/UCL-Biosciences/2025_Biosciences_Computational_Training_Material/blob/main/workshops/W4_AI_LLMs_ML/Copilot%20for%20Researchers%20Session.pdf). I thought this gave a good intro to AI and LLMs, as well as demonstrating a lot of amazing ideas for using LLMs/Copilot. I had lots of questions we didn't have time for and I guess many of you have questions, too. It woud be good to discuss further - we could have an LLM coffee morning at some point? We didn't discuss the risks of using LLMs and what we can do to mitigate those risks. Something v important that I encourage everyone to think about.

The machine learning material we looked at is available [here](https://github.com/ScryptIQ-ai/UCL-Biosciences-ML). I like that it introduces the ML protocol, including preprocessing steps, which is crucial in ML. It also shows ~five ML models and compares their performance - you could try any or all of them in your own research. 

## Resources
Ryan's slides have a list of training opportunities from Microsft, including [Copilot chat](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/explore-microsoft-365-copilot-business-chat/), [generating good prompts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-prompts-for-generative-ai-training-tools/), and [using AI agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/fundamentals-generative-ai/).

There are plenty of resources about safe use of LLMs, e.g.:
- [Ten Simple Rules for AI-Assisted Coding in Science](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22254)
- UCL's [intro to Copilot](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2024/mar/more-secure-generative-ai-tool-available-staff-and-students)

Adam and Laurence work for [Learn to Discover](https://learntodiscover.ai/), where they teach a combination of python and AI. These are more in-depth courses that you complete part-time over a number of months. More of a technical exercise than the intros we are getting at training. Colleagues have said the courses are excellent and I'd encourage people to have a look if you are interested in further practice.

The material we looked at is available [here](https://github.com/ScryptIQ-ai/UCL-Biosciences-ML) and another similar example is [here](https://github.com/ScryptIQ-ai/AIBIO-L2D-demo/tree/main).
