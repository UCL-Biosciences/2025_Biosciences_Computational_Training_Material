# Intro to Python Material
## Content
The material we went through was based on [this carpentries lesson](https://github-pages.arc.ucl.ac.uk/python-novice-gdp-penguins/instructor/index.html). For more info and practice, working through the full lesson would be good. You can use the [data](https://github-pages.arc.ucl.ac.uk/python-novice-gdp-penguins/instructor/index.html#obtain-lesson-materials) in the original material or the dataset we used in the workshop is also here: `workshops/W1_intro_python/data`.
